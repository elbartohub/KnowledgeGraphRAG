# GraphRAG Visualization Enhancement Plan

## 🎯 GraphRAG Features to Implement

### 1. Entity Extraction & Knowledge Graph
- Extract named entities from documents (people, places, organizations)
- Build relationships between entities
- Create interactive network visualization

### 2. Document Relationship Mapping
- Show how documents relate to each other
- Visualize topic clusters
- Display citation networks

### 3. Interactive Graph Interface
- Node-link diagrams using D3.js or vis.js
- Zoom, pan, filter capabilities
- Click nodes to see related documents
- Highlight paths between concepts

### 4. Enhanced RAG Pipeline
- Graph-aware retrieval (find related entities)
- Multi-hop reasoning through the graph
- Context-aware answer generation

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Entity Extraction
```python
# Add to requirements.txt
spacy>=3.4.0
networkx>=2.6.0
pyvis>=0.3.0

# Entity extraction pipeline
import spacy
import networkx as nx
from pyvis.network import Network
```

### Phase 2: Graph Database
```python
# Option 1: NetworkX (simple, local)
# Option 2: Neo4j (powerful, scalable)
# Option 3: ChromaDB with graph extensions
```

### Phase 3: Visualization
```javascript
// Frontend: D3.js, vis.js, or Cytoscape.js
// Interactive graph with:
// - Force-directed layout
// - Clustering algorithms
// - Search and filter
// - Export capabilities
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Retrieval
```python
# Graph-aware RAG
def graph_retrieval(query, k=5):
    # 1. Standard vector search
    # 2. Entity extraction from query
    # 3. Graph traversal to find related entities
    # 4. Expand search with graph context
    # 5. Return enhanced results
```

## 📊 Visualization Types

1. **Document Network**: Show document similarities
2. **Entity Graph**: People, places, concepts relationships
3. **Topic Clusters**: Group related content
4. **Citation Network**: Reference relationships
5. **Query Path**: Show reasoning path for answers
6. **Temporal Graph**: Changes over time

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### New Components:
- Graph visualization panel
- Entity browser
- Relationship explorer
- Graph statistics dashboard
- Export/import functionality

### Integration Points:
- Add graph view to existing 3-column layout
- Show related entities when viewing documents
- Display reasoning path with answers
- Interactive graph-based search

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Better Understanding**: See document relationships visually
2. **Enhanced Discovery**: Find connections not obvious in text
3. **Improved Retrieval**: Graph context improves answers
4. **Research Tool**: Great for academic/business research
5. **Debugging**: Visualize how the RAG system works

## 🚀 Quick Start Implementation

### Minimal GraphRAG Addition:
1. Add entity extraction to document processing
2. Create simple network visualization
3. Show document relationships
4. Add graph-based filtering
